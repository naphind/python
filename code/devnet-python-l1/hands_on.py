# TASK: Write a print statement that displays both the type and value of `pi`
pi = math.pi

print ("value of Pi is", pi)
print ("Type of Pi is", type(pi))


# TASK: Write a conditional to print out if `i` is less than or greater than 50

i = random.randint(0, 100)

print ("value of i is ", i)

if i < 50:
	print ("I is less than fifty")

# TASK: Write a conditional that prints the color of the picked fruit

# TASK: Write a function that multiplies two numbers and returns the result
# Define the function here.

def multiply (num1, num2):
	num3 = num1*num2
	return num3


# TASK: Now call the function a few times to calculate the following answers

print("12 x 96 =", multiply(12,96))
print("48 x 17 =", multiply(48,17))
print("196523 x 87323 =", multiply (196523, 87323))
